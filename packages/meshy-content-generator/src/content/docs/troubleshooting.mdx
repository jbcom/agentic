## Missing MESHY_API_KEY

**Symptom**: `MESHY_API_KEY is required.`

**Fix**: Set the key in your environment or `.env` file.

```bash
MESHY_API_KEY=your_api_key
```

## Validation failures

If `content-gen validate` reports missing inputs, check:

- The manifest contains the required fields.
- The pipeline step path matches the manifest path.
- Lookup tables referenced by inputs are loaded.

## Pipeline stuck or slow

- Meshy tasks can take time. The runner streams until completion.
- Check Meshy queue status and credits in your Meshy dashboard.
- For CI, use VCR replay to avoid long waits.

## Preview not loading

- Ensure the asset is inside the working directory.
- Verify `assetDir` and `file` query parameters are correct.
- The preview uses `/file` to serve content; open `http://localhost:5177/file?...` directly to confirm access.

## CORS / local access

The preview is intended for local use. If you expose the API publicly, add authentication and strict CORS.
