title: CI Setup

Use VCR recording to make Meshy calls deterministic in CI.

## Record once

```bash
POLLY_MODE=record pnpm test:unit
```

This writes recordings to `test/__recordings__`. Commit them so CI can replay.

## Replay in CI

```bash
POLLY_MODE=replay pnpm test:unit
```

## Suggested CI steps

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm check
pnpm test
pnpm test:e2e
pnpm build
```
