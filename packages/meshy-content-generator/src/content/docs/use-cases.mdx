title: Use Cases
---

## Character pipeline (text → image → 3D → rig → animation)

Use `character-full` when you want the full Meshy workflow and a rigged character ready for animation.

```bash
content-gen run character-full ./assets/characters/hero \
  --pipelines ./pipelines/definitions \
  --tasks ./tasks/definitions
```

Typical outputs:

- `concept.png`
- `preview.glb`
- `refined.glb`
- `rigged.glb`
- `animations/*.fbx`

## Prop pipeline (text → 3D)

Use `prop` for rapid asset iteration.

```bash
content-gen run prop ./assets/props/katana \
  --pipelines ./pipelines/definitions \
  --tasks ./tasks/definitions
```

## API-driven generation

Run the same pipelines over HTTP from build systems or internal tools.

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5177/runs \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "pipelineName": "character",
    "assetDir": "./assets/characters/hero",
    "wait": true
  }'
```
