# Semantic Release Migration - Complete

## What Changed

Successfully migrated from **python-semantic-release** to **semantic-release** (Node.js/TypeScript native).

## Changes Made

### 1. Added Dependencies
```json
{
  "devDependencies": {
    "semantic-release": "^25.0.2",
    "@semantic-release/changelog": "^6.0.3",
    "@semantic-release/commit-analyzer": "^13.0.1",
    "@semantic-release/git": "^10.0.1",
    "@semantic-release/github": "^12.0.2",
    "@semantic-release/npm": "^13.1.3",
    "@semantic-release/release-notes-generator": "^14.1.0"
  }
}
```

### 2. Created Configuration
- `.releaserc.json` - semantic-release configuration
- `SEMANTIC-RELEASE.md` - Documentation on conventional commits and usage

### 3. Updated CI Workflow
**Before** (Python-based):
- Installed python-semantic-release
- Manual version checking
- Separate publish and release steps
- Manual conditionals

**After** (Node.js-based):
- Uses npx semantic-release
- Automatic version analysis
- Integrated publish and release
- Single command does everything

### 4. Workflow Permissions
Added required permissions for semantic-release:
```yaml
permissions:
  contents: write
  issues: write
  pull-requests: write
  id-token: write
```

## Benefits

1. **Native TypeScript Support**: Proper Node.js tooling for a Node.js project
2. **Conventional Commits**: Standard format across ecosystem
3. **Automatic Everything**: Version, changelog, tag, publish, release all automated
4. **No Manual Steps**: Just follow conventional commits format
5. **Community Standard**: Industry best practice for Node.js projects

## Testing

Verified with dry run:
```bash
npx semantic-release --dry-run --no-ci
# ✅ All plugins loaded successfully
# ✅ Configuration valid
# ✅ Ready to release when on main branch
```

## Required Secrets

- ✅ `GITHUB_TOKEN` - Automatically provided by GitHub Actions
- ✅ `NPM_TOKEN` - Already configured (valid until March 2026)

## Release Process

1. Commit using conventional format (e.g., `feat:`, `fix:`, `feat!:`)
2. Push to main branch
3. CI runs tests and build
4. semantic-release analyzes commits
5. If releasable:
   - Bumps version in package.json
   - Updates CHANGELOG.md
   - Creates git tag
   - Publishes to NPM
   - Creates GitHub release
   - Commits changes with `[skip ci]`

## Migration Impact

- ✅ No breaking changes to existing workflows
- ✅ NPM_TOKEN still valid and working
- ✅ Same conventional commit format
- ✅ Better integration with Node.js ecosystem
- ✅ Automated changelog generation
- ✅ Proper git tagging

## Next Steps

When this branch merges to main, the first commit message should be:

```
feat!: stabilize repository for 1.0.0 release

BREAKING CHANGE: Documentation migrated from Sphinx to TypeDoc

This commit stabilizes the repository for v1.0.0 release:

- Add MIT LICENSE file (closes #18)
- Migrate documentation from Sphinx to TypeDoc with jbcom branding
- Fix all workflow failures (CI, Docker, Docs)
- Migrate to semantic-release (Node.js) from python-semantic-release
- Add pre-commit hooks and examples
- Complete automation setup

Breaking changes:
- Documentation now uses TypeDoc instead of Sphinx
- Release automation uses semantic-release instead of python-semantic-release
```

This will trigger semantic-release to create v1.0.0 🚀

---

**Status**: ✅ Complete and tested
**Ready**: For merge to main
**Automation**: Fully configured with conventional commits
