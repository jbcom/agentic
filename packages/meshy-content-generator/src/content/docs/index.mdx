# meshy-content-generator

A declarative Meshy content-generation pipeline engine with a CLI and API. Pipelines and tasks are defined as JSON and optimized for Meshy endpoints.

## Key ideas

- Define **pipelines** and **tasks** as JSON.
- Provide **manifests** per asset to supply prompts/config.
- Run from CLI, API server, or embed as a library.

## Use cases

- Generate 3D characters/props from structured manifests
- Orchestrate multi‑step AI workflows
- Standardize build‑time content pipelines
