## Cost & rate‑limit guidance

Meshy requests can be credit‑ and time‑intensive. Recommended practices:

- **Batch by asset type** (characters vs props) to reduce pipeline churn.
- **Record VCR fixtures** for CI to avoid burning credits on tests.
- **Use preview → refine** intentionally; refine tasks are the most expensive.
- **Throttle parallel runs** if you are seeing rate‑limit errors.

## When to use each pipeline

- `character-full`: full production asset pipeline (text → image → preview → refine → rig → animation)
- `character`: reduced flow when you want faster iteration
- `prop`: fast prop generation (text → 3D)

## Suggested asset folder layout

```text
assets/
├── characters/
│   └── hero/
│       └── manifest.json
└── props/
    └── katana/
        └── manifest.json
```

## Recording VCR fixtures

```bash
POLLY_MODE=record pnpm test:unit
```

Commit the recordings under `test/__recordings__` so CI can replay.
