Pipelines are JSON files in `pipelines/definitions/*.pipeline.json`. Each step references a task definition and can override inputs.

Example:

```json
{
  "name": "character",
  "version": "2.1.0",
  "steps": [
    { "id": "concept", "task": "text-to-image" },
    { "id": "model", "task": "multi-image-to-3d", "dependsOn": ["concept"] }
  ]
}
```
