title: Preview
---

The preview route hosts a lightweight viewer for generated assets so you can validate Meshy outputs quickly.

## Start the server

```bash
pnpm dev
```

## Open a preview

```bash
http://localhost:5177/preview?assetDir=./assets/characters/hero&file=model.glb
```

- `assetDir` must be inside the current working directory.
- `file` is resolved relative to the asset directory.

The preview uses `<model-viewer>` and supports basic camera controls and lighting out of the box.

The viewer fetches assets through the `/file` endpoint so only the requested file is served.
