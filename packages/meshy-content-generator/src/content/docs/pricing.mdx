## How credits are used

Meshy charges credits per task. The most expensive steps are typically:

1. Text‑to‑3D refine
2. Rigging
3. Animation

Preview passes are cheaper and faster, so use preview to validate before refine.

## Reduce cost per iteration

- **Prototype with preview only** before running refine.
- **Reuse manifests** for deterministic runs.
- **Limit animation sets** during iteration.
- **Batch runs** (avoid small, repeated single‑asset runs).

## CI best practices

Use VCR recordings to avoid spending credits in CI.

```bash
POLLY_MODE=record pnpm test:unit
POLLY_MODE=replay pnpm test:unit
```

## Where to check balances

Use the Meshy dashboard to monitor credit usage and queue status.
