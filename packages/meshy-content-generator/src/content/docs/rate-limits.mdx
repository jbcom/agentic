title: Rate‑Limit Recovery
---

## Symptoms

- Meshy requests fail with 429 or rate‑limit errors.
- Pipelines stall or slow down significantly.

## Immediate mitigation

- Reduce concurrent runs.
- Back off and retry after a short delay.
- Prefer preview tasks first; run refine in a separate window.

## Operational strategies

- **Queue runs** instead of firing parallel jobs.
- **Stagger animation runs** (animations can fan out quickly).
- **Use VCR in CI** to avoid hitting Meshy from tests.

## Suggested default policy

If you hit a rate limit, retry with exponential backoff. The Meshy client already retries on 429s using a linear backoff. You can increase `maxRetries` and `retryDelayMs` when initializing `MeshyClient`.
